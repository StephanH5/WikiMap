# WikiMap
This Java based Android Studio Project was made so that users can explore Wikipedia in a new way on their Android device.

The basic premise is to load a wikipedia page to display onto your phone.
You should then be able to click on a link on the page and 'open' it in a direction. such as Up, Down, Left, and Right.
Swiping to a direction should then load the page associated with the direction itself, with the previous page being associated with the opposite direction of the current page.

For example:

Opening a wiki page on 'Baking' initially.
Setting the 'Pie' wiki page to 'Down'.
Swiping down from 'Baking' should bring you to 'Pie'.
Swiping up from 'Pie' will then bring you back to the same Baking page.

This Application is in early development and should be considered unreleased or in an Alpha at best.
